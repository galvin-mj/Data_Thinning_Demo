% The Online Thinning algorithm uses the first frame for training, and
% process the video frame-by-frame. On each frame, the SIFT features are
% computed on a grid placed 33 x 33 pixels apart (can be changed by setting
% up the parameters for SIFT in Online_Thinning_Video), and the algorithm
% processes all SIFT features from the same frame in a mini-batch. An
% anomalouseness score is assigned by the Online Thinning algorithm for
% each SIFT feature vector (which corresponds to a small patch in the 
% image). After the computation of the scores, we flag the top 5% of
% patches with the highest and use only the flagged patches and a reference
% frame (reset every 30 frames) to stabilize the flagged patches. The
% stabilization method is explained in 
% http://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/examples/video-stabilization-using-point-feature-matching.html
% Due to the small number of pixels in the thinned frames (only 5% of 
% patches), the stabilization method occasionally is unable to find enough
% matching points, which results in sudden shift and warp of images. This
% can be alleviated by increasing the number of patches in the flagged 
% video or including some surrounding pixels around each flagged patch in
% the stabilization.

% The output video will be stored in 'output_stabilize_demo.avi'. Note that because
% the first frame is used for initialization, the actual output video will
% be one frame shorter than the input video.
