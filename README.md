# Data_Thinning_Demo
This is a demo for the Online Thinning algorithm with a parking lot surveillance video

To run the demo on the original surveillance video, run Run_Demo.m
To run the demo on the surveillance video with artificial jitters and stabilization, run Run_Demo_Stabilize_Jittered_Video.m 

Note: in order to run the demo with jitters and stabilization, the Computer Vision System Toolbox (http://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/index.html) needs to be installed in MATLAB (R2013a or later). If you cannot run the stabilization demo, you can still check out the result video in /demo_videos/Stabilization_Result/

The surveillance video is included in /demo_videos/
